# iPhone style: Add a period after entering two spaces in Windows 10

![[iphone-period.png]]

Today we type even more than ever during this pandemic. Working from home is a default now.

This AutoHotKey script will add a period after you end a sentence by using two spaces. iPhone style period ending on Windows 10!
<!-- more -->
``` ah
;iPhone style period after space
:*?: ::. `
```

You need to add this to a *.ahk file (maybe in Documents) after installing AutoHotKey which you can get from https://www.autohotkey.com/

You can add all sorts of little helpers here for use in your windows machine. Do a lot of fast and different stuff with just your keyboard!

Happy typing! âœŒ
