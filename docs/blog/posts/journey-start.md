# This is a start

I started this little site to document little snippets I use regularly so I don't loose them. I figured it would be a good thing to share them with the world!

These will include mainly Linux-related topics but ultimately anything tech-related will be included.

I chose `mkdocs` since it uses Markdown files as the source. I'm very familiar with Markdown and regularly use it to create very organized and usable note files in between code.
